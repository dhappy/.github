# The Department of Happiness

This was my company long ago. The principle was that I'd record people's reactions to events & use that data to recommend a schedule.

Currently it is rough narrative describing a radical social change driven by new oprganizational structures built interfacing with an augmented reality game.

The core of everything is pairs of drivers patrolling regions.

Their primary role is to serve as an alternative to call instead of the police. They show up and at least one of then has the primary responsibility of capturing a livestream so that even if the camera is destroyed the footgage will be saved.

At the very least, the person who called the car will get access to the recording of the livestream. The cameraperson's partner could add other people in the vicinity to the stream if the original summoner permits.

A secondary function of the vehicles is as a couriers' network. Delivering tools and food and people, but most importantly substances; both pharmaceutical and recreatioinal.

There's [13 teams](https://github.com/dhappy/TRWBL/blob/master/13-13s.md#thirteen-thirteens) representing intersections of [13 sets of of 13 things](https://dhappy.github.io/13-13s/).

One aspect of membership on any of the teams is access to a codex that helps decipher team associations. Tags in the form of stickers could be used to demark places in the read world. A pair of matching stickers on either side of an entranceway denoting whose demense you are entering.

I want to represent the universe as a nested set of divisions of the available physical space. At each level, the children of that level combine to partition the space: a property is divided into lots which contain yards, buildings, etc.; buildings can be broken into floors and then rooms and the furniture they contain.

Leases are nested 13 levels deep. Each level pays to the level above except for the top which pays for compensation for recorded hours of work on behalf of the organization.

The organization is the combination of all the teams and when funds are allocated to it, they are distributed to the teams according to their rankings.

Rankings are formulated by all the players creating a ranked listing of all the teams, with associated number rankings.

As with several of the scales in the game, values are both positive and negative: 5 ‚â• ùë† ‚â• ‚àí5. A fundamentalist Xtian player might wish to rank substances ‚àí3 and sex ‚àí4.5 and have their vote count against the allocation for that need.

Substances is run by the Black Team where one submits a video attestation as proof of blackness which is reviewed by previously verified Black people.

In order to qualify one must satisfy the reviewer that they are living a Black Life. A police office could hold black tokens, but they would hold Gold as well to represent they are part of the establishment.

The existing United States govenment is represented in the game by one of the teams: Gold. People receive Gold tokens for working for the man with the understanding they will not sell their tokens until they leave government service.

It allows law enforcement to voluntarily identify themselves in a virtual environment.

If an account is believed to belong to law enforement but isn't holding Gold tokens, it can be marked with Blaze.

Development of the software is performed by users picking issues, recording pair programming sessions, creating [metadata about the session](//dhappy.github.io/consult/), then exchanging their work vouchers for compensation through a subsidized market to where everyone makes at least $15 per hour.
